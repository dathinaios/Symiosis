# Symiosis

## Primary

* Expose customisation options at ~/.symiosis/config
* Make sure the HTMl for the markdown is sleek and beautiful.
* make the bar over the note pane when editing that has the title and info half the height and make sure you adjust the buttons etc. to fit
* make the default height of the file list 4 lines.
* make the pane size adjustable by dragging dividers with the mouse and remember last setting in the app. 
* ctrl-r should reload/refresh the notes directory and rebuild cache etc.
* ctrl-x should delete currnt note

*Titles have priority only when they are exact matches other wise not.
* hypocrit should not display first the hypnosis note. Titles have priority only when they are exact matches other wise not.

## Secondary
