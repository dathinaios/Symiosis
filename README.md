## Primary

* ctrl-u, ctrol-d up and down while ESC is focused
* o opens in external editor
* needs to focus on search by default (maybe because it is dev i don't know)
* a bit lighter note display for easy reading but not light.
* hypocrit should not display first the hypnosis note. Titles have priority only when they are exact matches other wise not.
